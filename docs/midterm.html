                        Acher and Esnault (2016) [1] conducted large-scale chess
                        analysis using Stockfish, revealing patterns in human
                        decision-making. Silver et al. (2017) [2] introduced
                        AlphaZero, an AI that achieved superhuman performance in
                        chess through self-play, combining deep reinforcement
                        learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search. McIlroy-Young et
                        al. (2020) [3] developed Maia, an AI model fine-tuned to
                        mimic human chess play, including mistakes, for more
                        relatable and educational purposes.

                        <strong>Dataset Description:</strong>A standard Lichess
                        dataset contains chess game information such as player
                        IDs, ratings, game results (win, loss, or draw), time
                        control, and termination reasons (e.g., resignation or
                        checkmate). Each game is identified by a unique ID and
                        includes metadata like the opening name and ECO code,
                        date and time, and the move list in Portable Game
                        Notation (PGN). Some datasets may also include move
                        timestamps, annotations for notable moves, or "optimal"
                        engine evaluations at certain moves. Optional player
                        metadata, such as titles (GM, IM) may also be available.

                <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Current chess tools
                        excel at suggesting the best moves but lack the
                        capability to warn players about the likelihood of
                        making blunders in specific positions, particularly
                        crucial for casual players rated 1000-2000 Elo. There is
                        a need for a specialized chess engine that can assess
                        and communicate the "blunder risk" of any given
                        position, taking into account position complexity and
                        common mistake patterns at different skill levels. This
                        tool would create crucial awareness for players before
                        making critical decisions, helping them approach risky
                        positions with appropriate caution.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Motivation:</strong> The recent chess boom,
                        accelerated by the pandemic, has highlighted a critical
                        gap in chess tools for casual players. While traditional
                        chess engines focus on finding perfect moves, they don't
                        help players understand when they're in dangerous
                        positions likely to cause blunders. A blunder prediction
                        system would serve as a crucial awareness tool,
                        especially for newer players who often make game-losing
                        mistakes without recognizing the risks. This addresses
                        the growing need for practical tools that help prevent
                        catastrophic errors rather than just suggesting optimal
                        moves.

                                The system downloads large datasets of chess
                                games from Lichess's public database. These
                                datasets contain standard rated chess games
                                played during specific months and are initially
                                compressed to save storage space. The data comes
                                in a special compressed format (.zst) which
                                needs to be unzipped before it can be used. The
                                downloading and unzipping processes happen
                                simultaneously for multiple files to save time,
                                with visual indicators showing the progress of
                                both operations. Once uncompressed, the data
                                becomes available in PGN format, which is the
                                standard format for recording chess games,
                                containing all the moves and relevant game
                                information.

                                Stockfish Engine Integration: To determine what
                                constitutes a blunder, the system leverages
                                Stockfish, one of the strongest chess engines
                                available. For each position, Stockfish
                                evaluates both the current position and the
                                position after a move is made. The difference in
                                these evaluations, measured in centipawns
                                (1/100th of a pawn's value), reveals how much
                                the move weakened the position. If this
                                difference exceeds a certain threshold, the move
                                is classified as a blunder, providing our ground
                                truth for training the model.
