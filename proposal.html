    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction/Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literature Review</strong></li>
<p>
In 2016, Acher and Esnault [1] pioneered large-scale chess game analysis using the Stockfish engine, processing millions of positions to identify patterns in human decision-making and blunder detection. This large dataset enabled the exploration of player behavior and laid the groundwork for advanced machine learning applications in chess.
</p>

<p>
Building on these foundations, Silver et al. [2] in 2017 introduced AlphaZero, an AI that learned to play chess through self-play without human input. AlphaZero revolutionized the field by combining deep reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), achieving superhuman performance across multiple board games including chess, shogi, and Go, within hours.
</p>

<p>
In 2020, McIlroy-Young et al. [3] took a step further in modeling human-like play. Their model, Maia, was fine-tuned to predict individual player moves based on datasets of online chess games. Unlike AlphaZero, which optimized for perfect play, Maia aimed to mimic human tendencies, including mistakes and imprecisions, thus offering more relatable and educational AI for players.
</p>

           <li><strong>Dataset Description:</strong>A standard Lichess dataset contains chess game information such as player IDs, ratings, game results (win, loss, or draw), time control, and termination reasons (e.g., resignation or checkmate). Each game is identified by a unique ID and includes metadata like the opening name and ECO code, date and time, and the move list in Portable Game Notation (PGN). Some datasets may also include move timestamps, annotations for notable moves, or "optimal" engine evaluations at certain moves. Optional player metadata, such as titles (GM, IM) may also be available.</li>

       </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Problem Definition Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Chess engines have traditionally been designed to achieve optimal play, often surpassing human ability through brute-force calculations and deep evaluations. While these engines excel in performance, they lack the nuance and variability of human play, making them feel too robotic and predictable. There is a growing need for a chess engine that can simulate human-like decision-making, which incorporates not only the optimal move but also human characteristics such as occasional mistakes, strategic depth, and style preferences.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based chess engine that mimics human-like play across a wide range of skill levels, from 1000 to 2800 Elo. By analyzing a vast dataset of chess games, the model will learn to predict and generate moves that reflect human decision-making patterns. The engine will adjust its play style and strength in fine-grained Elo increments (e.g., 1000-1100, 1100-1200, etc.), ensuring a realistic opponent at every skill level. It will incorporate diverse strategies, controlled inaccuracies, and natural game progression, including opening repertoires, middlegame plans, and endgame techniques typical of human players.</li>

            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> This problem needs a solution because, since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/crosswords/chess/chess-is-booming.html" target="_blank">pandemic</a>, chess has experienced a massive surge in popularity, with millions of new players engaging with the game online. While traditional chess engines have advanced to superhuman levels of play, they are optimized for perfection and often make moves that are hard for average players to understand. This can be discouraging for the influx of learners and casual players who picked up chess during the pandemic, seeking to improve their skills or enjoy a more human-like playing experience.

A "human-like" chess engine can address this need by simulating the decision-making processes of real players, incorporating relatable mistakes, strategic thought processes, and diverse playing styles. Such an engine would serve as an educational tool and a more relatable opponent, enhancing the learning curve for new players and providing a more engaging experience for players at all levels. Given the explosive growth of online chess since the pandemic, there is a strong demand for AI systems that don’t just play perfectly, but play in a way that humans can learn from and enjoy.</li>

    <!-- Methods Section -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing Methods:</strong>
                Our dataset is in PGN format, which encodes the moves of a chess game as a sequence of strings. Since we aim to predict human-like moves at specific positions, thorough data preprocessing is essential.
                <ul>
                    <li>Extracting Positional Features: Chess requires strong spatial reasoning, as players often visualize the board as a 2D image. To provide models with this spatial context, we will simulate the game up to the desired position and represent it as an 8x8 grid, where each square contains information about the piece occupying it. This technique is inspired by approaches like AlphaGo [4]. For this, we will use the <code>python-chess</code> library, which supports PGN parsing and board rendering. </li>
                    <li>Eliminating Non-representative Positions: Chess involves both memorization and strategic thinking. Positions where moves are driven by memorized patterns (like early-game openings) or time constraints (when players have less than 10 seconds on the clock) don’t reflect true human reasoning. To improve the quality of our data, we will exclude these positions using the <code>pandas.DataFrame.drop</code> function. </li>
                    <li>Upsampling:  Certain moves, like promoting a pawn to a bishop, are far less common than more standard ones, like promoting to a queen. To balance the dataset and ensure even representation of all move types, we will oversample the rarer moves. The <code>sklearn.utils.resample</code> function will assist in this process. </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Algorithms:</strong>
                We will use ML algorithms to predict the next human-like move in a chess game.
                <ul>
                    <li> VAE (Unsupervised): Traditional ML methods struggle with spatial data like images, so we need a way to convert chess positions into dense representations. We’ll use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an encoder-decoder model that learns to reconstruct inputs from compressed latent representations. Since VAEs don't require labeled data, we’ll train it exclusively on chess positions and use the encoder to generate dense features for each position. </li>
                    <li>Random Forest (Supervised): Random Forest is a fast and efficient ML algorithm for classification. Since we have a large dataset, this is a natural choice for classical ML algorithm. We will train a random forest classifier to predict next human moves.</li>
                    <li>MLP (Supervised): A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a deep learning model capable of capturing complex patterns in data. Given the success of deep learning in various tasks, we will employ MLP to predict human-like chess moves. </li>
            </li>
